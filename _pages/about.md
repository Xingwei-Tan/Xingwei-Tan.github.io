## About me

I am a Reasearch Associate (post-doc) in the School of Computer Science, University of Sheffield. I am working with Prof. Nikos Aletras on Responsible AI UK's Â£3.5M Keystone project: Addressing Socio-technical Limitations of LLMs for Medical and Social Computing [AdSoLve] (https://rai.ac.uk/research/keystone-projects/). AdSoLve focuses on evaluating and addressing LLMs' limitations in high-stakes applications (e.g., legal and medical domains).

I obtained my PhD from Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, supervised by Prof. Yulan He and Dr. Gabriele Pergola.
My thsis, titled "Understanding Event Relation in Text via Representations Learning and LLM-based Graph Generation,", focuses on analysing event relations with geometric deep learning, Bayesian learning, and Large Language Models.

## Research Interests

My recent research aims to improve LLMsâ€™ ability in logical reasoning, which is highly related to legal applications. I am interested in how Neuro-symbolic methods can improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs.
