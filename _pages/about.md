## About me

I am a Reasearch Associate (post-doc research) in the School of Computer Science, University of Sheffield. 
I am a member of the EPSRC project "[Addressing Socio-technical Limitations of LLMs for Medical and Social Computing](https://rai.ac.uk/research/keystone-projects/)" ([AdSoLve](https://adsolve.github.io/)), which is funded via Responsible AI UK as a keystone project.
I am working with Prof. Nikos Aletras on improving logical reasoning and legal reasoning.

I obtained my PhD from Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, supervised by Prof. Yulan He and Dr. Gabriele Pergola.
My thsis, titled "Understanding Event Relation in Text via Representations Learning and LLM-based Graph Generation,", focuses on analysing event relations with geometric deep learning, Bayesian learning, and Large Language Models.

## Research Interests

My research broadly lies in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am happy to collaborate on the following topics:

* **Reasoning:** Legal Reasoning, Logical Reasoning, Mathematical Reasoning
* **Natural Language Understanding** Event Detection, Event Relation Analysis
* **AI for Policing** Harmful Text Detection, Records Summarization
* **AI for Science**
